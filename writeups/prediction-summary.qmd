### Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of your work on the primary task. Indicate what input data was used, what method was used for binary class predictions, what method was used for multiclass predictions, and what estimated accuracies were achieved.

> *Header and paragraph content was scraped from the raw webpages and processed into term frequencies of word tokens and transformed into TF-IDF weighted features. To reduce over-fitting, the top 1,000 most frequent tokens were retained. For binary class predictions, a feed-forward neural network model and recurrent neural network model were used with accuracy of 0.784 and 0.574, respectively. For multi-class predictions, a support vector machine model was used with accuracy of ##INPUT VALUE HERE##. *

### Preprocessing

> *Our preprocessing pipeline begins by extracting text content from the elements of HTML documents, focusing on the main textual information. The extracted text is then cleaned to remove URLs, emails, punctuation, symbols, numbers, and extraneous whitespace, while normalizing case to lowercase and handling contractions and word splits. The cleaned text is tokenized into unigrams (single words) and bigrams (word pairs) while removing stopwords to focus on meaningful terms. Finally, the tokenized text is quantitatively represented using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), capturing the importance of each token or bigram in relation to the document and the entire dataset, and stored in a wide-format matrix for modeling.*

### Methods

Describe your final predictive models. Include one paragraph with details on the binary classification approach, and one on the multiclass approach. Include for each:

-   what ML/statistical method was used

-   model specification and hyperparameter selection

-   training method

^^ ##REMOVE ONCE PARTS ARE FINISHED##

Binary Classification: 
For binary classification, two machine learning models were used: a feedforward NN and recurrent NN (RNN). 

The feedforward NN was designed with one hidden layer containing 10 neurons and used a sigmoid activation function for the output layer. The model was trained with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and it was trained for 10 epochs and a batch size of 32. 

The RNN was designed using an embedding layer and a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer with 32 units. The model used a sigmoid activation function for the dense output layer and was trained with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

Multiclass Classification:

### Results

Indicate the predictive accuracy of the binary classifications and the multiclass classifications. Provide a table for each, and report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.[^1]

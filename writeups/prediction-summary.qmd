### Abstract

Provide a 3-5 sentence summary of your work on the primary task. Indicate what input data was used, what method was used for binary class predictions, what method was used for multiclass predictions, and what estimated accuracies were achieved.

> *Header and paragraph content was scraped from the raw webpages and processed into term frequencies of word tokens. For binary classification, a two-layer neural network yielded an estimated 81.4% accuracy; for multiclass classification, a support vector machine gave 78% accuracy.*

### Preprocessing

> *Our preprocessing pipeline begins by extracting text content from the elements of HTML documents, focusing on the main textual information. The extracted text is then cleaned to remove URLs, emails, punctuation, symbols, numbers, and extraneous whitespace, while normalizing case to lowercase and handling contractions and word splits. The cleaned text is tokenized into unigrams (single words) and bigrams (word pairs) while removing stopwords to focus on meaningful terms. Finally, the tokenized text is quantitatively represented using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), capturing the importance of each token or bigram in relation to the document and the entire dataset, and stored in a wide-format matrix for modeling.*

### Methods

Describe your final predictive models. Include one paragraph with details on the binary classification approach, and one on the multiclass approach. Include for each:

-   what ML/statistical method was used

-   model specification and hyperparameter selection

-   training method

### Results

Indicate the predictive accuracy of the binary classifications and the multiclass classifications. Provide a table for each, and report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.[^1]
